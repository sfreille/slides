# **Background and motivation** {background=#00345E}

<!--
## A *different* way of teaching & doing research in political economy

-   Over the course of two years, a series of classroom interventions
    were designed and applied in the Political Economy elective class
    at Facultad de Ciencias Económicas (UNC)
	- main purpose $\longrightarrow$ to enrich learning experience by
      testing key theories, results and concepts in politics and
      political economy [but often *alien* to undergraduate students]

 
## Motivation and literature: voting choice models

-   Pedagogical
    - easier to grasp abstract and theoretical concepts --Condorcet
      winner, single-peaked and single-crossing properties,
      probabilistic two-dimensional voting, etc. 
-   Methodological
    - helps to develop ideas, methods and procedures to understand
      domestic politics and policies
-->	

> Action speaks louder than words but not nearly as often.\
> **\[Mark Twain\]**

## Motivation and literature: context

- Research agenda fits along **3 (three) loosely related fields**:
  1. Voting choice models (PolEcon)
  2. Social identity theory (Social Psychology)
  3. Ideology puzzle/conflicted conservatism (Public Opinion)
- Fueled **new surge of research** in important political economy
  topics 
  - polarization, populism and democracy, policy swings, democratic
    backsliding
	
## Motivation and literature: voting choice

- **Median voter theorem (MVT)** extremely limited as is; increasing
  polarization may render it pretty useless to explain and understand
- Probabilistic voting model (PVM) $\longrightarrow$ voters derive
  utility from:
  - consumption --fiscal policy affects income groups differently
    **[policy]**	
  - things other than consumption -non-economic policies, candidate
    attributes, group identity, etc **[ideology/identity]**
- May help to explain **why voters go against their
  policy preferences**
  - Lindbeck & Weibull (1987), Cukierman (1991), Roemer (1998), Groseclose (2001), Lee & Roemer (2006),

## Motivation and literature: social identity theory
  
- **Social identity theory** [Tajfel & Turner (1979), Turner & Oakes
  (1986), Fearon & Laitin (2000)] and **spin-offs** [Akerlof & Kranton (2000), Shayo
  (2009), Klor & Shayo (2010), Enke (2020), Gennaioli & Tabellini (2023)] 
  - a person's **identity based on group membership** (class,
    family, football team, party) 
- Groups give us a sense of social identity
  - allows for dividing the world between "us" and "them". **Tendency to
    exaggerate**:
	1. differences between groups [in-group vs out-group]
	2. similarities within groups [in-group]

## Motivation and literature: social identity theory

![In-group versus out-group](imagenes/social-identity-theory.png){fig-align="center"}
    
  
## Motivation and literature: ideology puzzle

- Ellis and Stimson (2012), Stimson (2015), Claassen et al (2015)
  $\longrightarrow$ between 25\% and 32\% of Americans experience
  **conflicted conservatism** (conservadurismo conflictuado) 
  - group which **self-perceive as conservative yet adopt liberal policy
    stance** --support liberal fiscal policies
	- 4 out of 10 republicans hold that universal health coverage is
      federal government's responsibility (Pew Research Center)
- Alrededor de un **90% de los argentinos rechazan recortes en salud y
  educación pública** [Encuesta Nacional de Creencias Sociales (UBA),
	  ondas 2023 y 2024]

# **Research agenda #1: Preference ordering and voting choices** {background=#00345E}

<!-- 
## Preference and voting

-   Year #1 $\longrightarrow$ single-peak preferences, vote transfer
    and political outcome surveys
	- employed a ranked-choice survey experiment to explore electoral
      preferences among public university students [relatively
      homogeneous course]
-   Year #2 $\longrightarrow$ the probabilistic voting model,
    individual preferences on ideology & policy and the *political
    compass*
	- political compass --i.e. multidimensional ideology and policy


# *1st Intervention*

First intervention was to employed 

This kind of survey helps analyze how students rank candidates from left to right and create opportunities to test foundational concepts like single peak preferences, vote transfers and agenda power.
-->


## Single-peaked preferences (SPP) and Condorcet cycles

-   Given $k$ alternatives denoted as $x_1,x_2,...,x_k$, which are ordered linearly, that is, $x_1<x_2<...<x_k$; and individual satisfies this condition if there doesn't exist an alternative $x_s$ such that its neighbouring alternatives ($x_{s-1}$ and $x_{s+1}$) are preferred over $x_s$.
    - SPP imply that the ordering of alternatives follows a pattern
      where individual welfare (utility) decreases as alternatives
      move away from the bliss point
-   **Condorcet winner** $\longrightarrow$ an alternative whichs is
    preferred to *any* other alternative by a majority of voters
	- if no Condorcet winner $\longrightarrow$ **voting cycles**
      [indeterminate collective choice]

## Individual preferences orderings

-   Two surveys were run:
    -   August 8th (before PASO)
    -   October 12th  (before general election)
-   Students were asked to rank five candidates from least (1) to most preferred (5). In order to produce preference orderings we sourced candidates policy position in a one-dimensional scale from a political compass organized by *La Nación* newspaper.

## First survey: August 8th  (PASO)

- We selected candidates as follows --from top (most left-wing) to
  bottom (most right-wing):
  - Juan Grabois (JG)
  - Sergio Massa (SM)
  - Horacio Rodriguez Larreta (HRL)
  - Patricia Bullrich (PB)
  - Javier Milei (JM)
- Note that **16 out of 48 (33\%) preference profiles produced non-single peaked** orderings.

## First survey: August 8th  (PASO) (cont.)

![](imagenes/spp_paso.png){fig-align="center"}

## Second survey: October 12th 

- We chose candidates who won their party’s *interna*. They were ordered from top (most left-wing) to bottom (most right-wing):
  - Myriam Bregman (MB)
  - Sergio Massa (SM)
  - Juan Schiaretti (JS)
  - Patricia Bullrich (PB)
  - Javier Milei (JM)
- Now **23 out of 41 (56%) profiles produced non-single peaked** orderings.

## Second survey: 12th October (cont.)

![](imagenes/spp_gen.png){fig-align="center"}

## Vote transfer

After the results of the general election, which determined the *ballotage* candidates: Javier Milei and Sergio Massa. At this stage, students were asked to report their votes cast in the first and second electoral rounds (*PASO* and general election, respectively), as well as their intended vote in the *ballotage*. By documenting their previous votes, this approach ensures that all respondents have disclosed their electoral behavior in each of the three stages, allowing for accurate individual-level tracking of voting patterns.

# **Research agenda #2: Multidimensional ideology and policies** {background=#00345E}

## 2nd Intervention

-   Step #1: Instrument design & testing
-   Step #2: Surveys & preliminary results
-   Step #3: Data treatment & methodology
-   Step #4: Presidential candidates political compass
-   Step #5: Voting inference based on the methodology

## Step #1: Instrument design & testing

- Self-perceived ideology placement scales as a proxy for ideology is
  misleading --conditioned by knowledege, engagement,
  education, subjective meaning, etc.

![](imagenes/anes-self-perceived-ideology.png){fig-align="center"}

## Step #1: Instrument design & testing

- We created two questionnaires and asked **students to respond to them** 
  - first *"ideology"* questionnaire both **economic and social themes** --vague,
  identitarian, philosophical questions
  - second *"policy"* questionnarie both **economic and social policies** --concrete,
    real questions
- **Ideology and policy questions are connected** --i.e. "smaller state..."
  and "privatizing Aerolineas, BNA y ARSAT"
  
  
## Step #1: Instrument design & testing

![Cuestionario -
Ideología](imagenes/preguntas-encuesta-ideologia.png){fig-align="center"}

![Cuestionario - Políticas](imagenes/preguntas-encuesta-policies.png){fig-align="center"}

## Step #1: Instrument design & testing

- All questions had a 6-item Likert-type scale ranging from
  "totalmente en desacuerdo" to "totalmente de acuerdo". 
  - we rescaled all ideology and policy questions to a two-dimensional
    space [x axis, economic dimension; y axis, social dimension]
- The figure displays each respondent's position on the
  **political compass**
    - **key feature** $\longrightarrow$ arrows indicate the **gap between an
    individual's policy stance and ideology position**
	  - the color of each point indicate candidate chosen in the 2023 runoff
      election 



## Step #2: Surveys & Preliminary Results

![Political compass w/o candidates. Votos en ballotage: rojo (Massa), azul (Milei), blanco (En
blanco).](imagenes/politicas%20--%20ideologia.png){fig-align="center"}

## Step #3: Data treatment and methodology

-  The PVM model again $\longrightarrow$ both policy ($\mathbf{q}$) and
   "ideology" ($\sigma^{ij}(P)$) components 

$$
V^{ij} = V^{j}(\mathbf{q}) + \sigma^{ij}(P)
$$

- We transform this inverse utility fn. to a **spatial loss function**. Formally:

$$
L^{ij} = \alpha \sqrt{(\sigma^{ij} - \sigma^A)^2} + \beta \sqrt{(q^{ij} - q^A)^2}
$$

-   Now we can estimate voting probabilities as a function of multidimensional ideological distances instead of unidimensional utilities.

## Step #4: Presidential candidates political compass

- Since we only asked students, we have no way to know $\sigma^A$ and
  $q^A$ (also for B party). 
  - but what *if we could ask candidates the same questions and
    scales*?
- We:
  - fed AI-engines transcripts of Presidential debates, official
    political platforms (CNE) and newspapers articles and ask it to
    use this information to scale questions for each candidate
  - focused only on PASO --i.e. closest to true beliefs and preferences
- This way, we built a proxy for candidate ideology and policy position
  which is now comparable to students' replies. 
	
<!--
-   Include a brief summary of the methodology applied. Justify the use of GPT/Natural Language Models with well-phrased prompts that allow us to isolate candidates' debate and reduce noise arising from the researcher's subjectivity and timing issues (over two years since the elections). In short, to isolate biases.
-   Complemented the results with the political platforms presented at the JNE
-   Focus on PASO only: in theory, the closest to their true beliefs and platforms, as per MVT.
-->

## Step #5: Voting inference

-   Put it all together, candidate ideal points and their voters'
    distances. 
    -   Voters are in both cases more centrist than their candidates. \[Median voter\]\^-1. Does polarization stem from voters or politicians?
    -   ¿A political *Say's Law*?

## Step #5: Voting inference (cont.)

![Political compass - Candidates (ideology)](imagenes\ideologia,%20candidatos.png)


<!--
Using the ChatGPT-based natural methodology, it is possible to identify each candidate’s position on the political compass. It is also possible to calculate the distance between each individual and the candidate they voted for, providing a quantitative measure of policy proximity.
-->


## Econometric model

- Using a logistic model to estimate the PVM, it's possible to
  forecast the vote of each individual. Following the next model, we
  get the predicted votes based on ideology and policy positions:

$$
P(V_i = 1) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left( \gamma_0 + \alpha \cdot ( d_{\text{ideo}}^{iA} - d_{\text{ideo}}^{iB}) + \beta \cdot ( d_{\text{pol}}^{iA}  -  d_{\text{pol}}^{iB}) \right)} + \epsilon 
$$

![Probabily to vote about ideology](imagenes\probabilidad%20ideologica,%20lineal.png)

## Econometric model (cont.)

- We can observe the correspondence between predicted and observed
  votes in the confussion matrix:

| Predicted \\ Observed |  0  |  1  |
|:---------------------:|:---:|:---:|
|           0           |  7  |  3  |
|           1           |  3  | 12  |


# **Issues, interpretation and further research** {background=#00345E}


## Interpretation
- ¿How to think about these (very preliminary) results? 
  1. Perceptions and misperceptions of issues $\longrightarrow$ people on the right and on the left of the political spectrum
    incur in a "polarization of reality" [Alesina, Miano & Stantcheva
    (2020)] $\longrightarrow$ their perceptions of how taxes (and the
    tax system) work are very different  --more information, better
    decisions


## Issues

## Further research

# **Appendix** {background=#00345E}


## Appendix I: Candidate's ideal policy points

- Rather than assuming candidates' ideal policy points (i.e. La
  Nación Brujula Política) we used our two survey questionnaires to
  "ask" the candidates where they stood on ideology and policies
  - transcript of first Presidential debate (01 october 2023)
- We used Google Gemini's 2.5 Pro Model to automate. 
  - the scale used was: 1-Totalmente en desacuerdo, 2-Muy en
    desacuerdo, 3-Levemente en desacuerdo, 4-Levemente de acuerdo,
    5-Muy de acuerdo, 6-Totalmente de acuerdo
	
## Appendix I: Candidates' ideal policy points (cont.)

- AI model was only asked to use transcription of debate as only
  source for answering survey questions on the 1-6 scale. AI model scores
  were cross-checked manually using excerpts from the transcript
  returned by the IA model
  - IA had to justify its score based on excerpts from actual
    transcript
- We chose a routine which meant each candidate was asked all the
  questions sequentially; we then moved onto the next candidate and so
  on

## Appendix I: Candidates' ideal policy points (cont.)

- We then asked the AI model to use external sources to try to score
  questions which went unanswered on the basis of the
  transcripts. These sources could be personal interviews, political
  platforms in the CNE and additional indirect sources. 
  - we limited the search to information within one year prior to the
    Presidential debate
- As in the first stage, we asked the AI model to provide quotes and
  excerpts used in its scoring. 
- All the questions were thus answered using this procedure.
