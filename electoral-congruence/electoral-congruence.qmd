# Abstract

In this paper we study the relationship between electoral outcomes for both federal and state level executive elections. Electoral outcomes for different offices in multi-tiered systems are likely to be mutually influenced through multiple channels. We explore two of this channels in this paper: institutional design and coattail effects. Traditionally, coattail effects have been studied between executive and legislative elections for the same government level. Instead, we explore both coattail effects and vote congruence for different-level office. Using data disaggregated at the department-level comprising 5 (five) elections during 2003-2019, we examine the relationship between votes for the elected President and governor in every district. We find evidence of vote dissimilarity between elected Presidents and governors and this is particularly strong when the national executive election is contested. Elected Presidents tend to increase their district-level relative electoral strength vis-a-vis elected gobernors regardless of party and coalition. This is consistent with anecdotal evidence and insights on the characteristis of coalition-building between national and sub-national governments.

# Resumen

En este artículo estudiamos la relación entre los resultados electorales para cargos ejecutivos nacionales y sub-nacionales. Los resultados electorales para diferentes cargos en sistemas multinivel son influenciados mutuamente a través de múltiples canales. Exploramos dos de estos canales: el diseño institucional y los efectos de arrastre. Tradicionalmente, los efectos de arrastre han sido estudiados entre elecciones a diferentes cargos (ejecutivas y legislativas) para un mismo nivel de gobierno. En este trabajo, exploramos los efectos de arrastre y la congruencia del voto para iguales cargos de diferente nivel de gobierno. Usando datos desagregados al nivel departamental para 5 (cinco) elecciones ejecutivas entre 2003 y 2019, examinamos la relación entre los votos obtenidos por el Presidente y gobernador electo en cada distrito. Encontramos evidencia de dismilaridad de votos entre los Presidentes y gobernadores electos y esta es particularmente importante cuando la elección nacional es disputada. Los Presidentes electos tienen a mejorar su desempeño electoral a nivel de distrito relativo al de los gobernadores electos independientemente de su partido y coalición. Esta evidencia se corresponde con evidencia anecdótica y caracterizaciones del proceso de construcción de coaliciones entre los gobiernos nacionales y sub-nacionales en Argentina. 	 

# Motivation

Electoral coattail effects, where the success of candidates or parties
in one election influences related elections, have primarily been
studied in presidential systems. However, the distinctive dynamics of
federal countries, with their subnational elections like gubernatorial
or regional contests, significantly impact national-level
outcomes. Scholars argue that the division of power between federal
and regional levels creates fertile ground for coattail effects. While
most research focuses on the conventional coattail effect, where
executive-level candidates bolster legislative-level candidates' vote
shares, there is potential for a bidirectional reverse coattail
effect. Additionally, specifically to federal countries, there is
another possible coattail effect between executive elections for
different levels of goverment. Our interest in this paper is in the
latter possibility. 

In the last 30 years, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence
documenting traditional coattail effects between concurrent
presidential and legislative national elections. Notable cases are US
Presidential elections of 1996, 2008 and 2016 where Clinton, Obama and
Trump had somewhat significant coattail effects on the congressional
and legislative electiosn. Another example is observed in South Korea's 2017 presidential and legislative elections. President Moon Jae-in's victory had a significant coattail effect on the Democratic Party of Korea, enabling them to secure a majority in the National Assembly. Similarly, in Argentina's 2015 elections, Mauricio Macri's victory in the presidential race had a coattail effect on his coalition's legislative candidates. The strong public support for Macri and his coalition, Cambiemos, resulted in increased voter support for their congressional candidates, contributing to a significant shift in the composition of the Argentine National Congress.


<!--
Coattail effects in elections have been observed in various countries
and political contexts. For instance, in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, discussions arose about potential coattail effects, with
Donald Trump's success as the Republican presidential candidate
potentially benefiting down-ballot Republican candidates in
congressional and state-level races. In Germany's 2013 federal
election, Chancellor Angela Merkel's popularity and leadership of the
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) generated a significant coattail
effect, leading to gains for the CDU in state-level
elections [@helms2017turning]. Similarly, in India's 2014 general
elections, Narendra Modi's popularity as the prime ministerial
candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) created a substantial
coattail effect, resulting in the BJP's success at multiple levels
[@schakel2019india] . The 2017 French presidential election
demonstrated a coattail effect as Emmanuel Macron's victory extended
to legislative elections, with his party, La République En Marche!,
gaining a majority in the National Assembly. These examples highlight
the varying degrees of coattail effects observed, influenced by
factors such as candidate popularity, campaign strategies, and the
characteristics of the electoral system in each country.
-->

Although somewhat less reported,"vertical" coattail effects, characterized by the positive influence of a presidential candidate on gubernatorial
elections, have been observed in several countries. In the 2016 U.S. elections, the popularity of presidential candidate Donald Trump translated into increased support for Republican gubernatorial candidates. Similarly, in France's 2017 presidential elections, President Emmanuel Macron's victory benefited En Marche! affiliated candidates in subsequent gubernatorial contests. South Korea's 2012 presidential elections saw President Park Geun-hye's success influencing the outcomes of gubernatorial races, while Brazil's 2002 elections showcased the impact of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's presidential campaign on affiliated gubernatorial candidates. These examples highlight how the performance and appeal of presidential candidates can shape gubernatorial elections, with implications for the electoral landscape.

However, under certain circumstances it may be possible that the
"vertical" coattail effect run in the opposite direction. This is
important since it involves the issue of electoral coordination in a
multi-level setting. In the presence of strong sub-national
governments with weaker institutional constraints and electoral rules,
"vertical" president coattails may be less important, even under
concurrent elections. This situation often goes along with a high (or
increasing) party denationalization. There are several examples of
countries which have gone down this path. Prior to 1991, regional
governments in Colombia were centrally appointed. Several reforms
introduced autonomous sub-national elections and the party system
became more fragmented. The 1994 Constitutional Reform in Argentina
and the collapse of the party system following the 2001-02 economic
crisis introduced both \textit{de-iure} and \textit{de-facto} constraints on
aspiring presidential candidates but most sub-national regimes kept
teir electoral rules unchanged\footnote{Argentina had different rules
for electing the President before 1994. Since 1972 Argentina enacted
a direct election system with a "french" \textit{ballotage} requiring more
than 50% of the votes to win the election without a second round
vote. In 1983, however, the newly elected regime reinstated an
indirect election system through the electoral college and no
\textit{ballotage}. The current regime eliminated the electoral college,
reinstated the direct election procedure but with a \textit{ballotage} system
when no party obtains at least 45% of the valid votes regardless of
winning margin or when no party obtains at least 40% with a 10% margin
with the second party.} In these conditions, sub-national
rulers may have a strong degree of autonomy and may prove instrumental
to presidential candidates. 

Coattail effects in elections are driven by several theoretical
channels that shed light on the mechanisms through which the success
or popularity of candidates or parties in one election can influence
related elections. These theoretical channels provide insights into
the factors that contribute to coattail effects and their impact on
electoral outcomes. One important theoretical channel is the role of
information and visibility. When a candidate or party achieves success
or garners popularity in an election, their increased visibility and
media attention can have a spill-over effect, leading to greater
awareness among voters about other candidates from the same party who
are running in related elections. This heightened information and
visibility can shape voter perceptions and influence their
decision-making process in subsequent elections.

Additionally, party identification and loyalty play a crucial role in
driving coattail effects. Voters who strongly identify with a
particular political party are more likely to support other candidates
from the same party. This loyalty stems from the belief that
candidates from the same party share common values, policy positions,
or ideology. As a result, voters may transfer their support for a
popular candidate or party to other candidates down the ballot,
contributing to coattail effects. The halo effect is another
theoretical channel that can contribute to coattail effects. The halo
effect refers to the phenomenon where voters extend their positive
evaluations of a popular or successful candidate to other candidates
from the same party. This cognitive bias can influence voter
perceptions and lead to increased support for down-ballot candidates
based on their association with the more popular candidate. The halo
effect operates on the assumption that the positive attributes or
performance of a top-of-the-ticket candidate will extend to other
candidates from the same party.

Strategic voting behavior also plays a role in coattail
effects. Voters may strategically vote for candidates down the ballot
to ensure policy alignment or to enhance the chances of their
preferred candidate's success. Strategic voting is driven by the
belief that a unified party control or cohesive policy agenda is more
desirable. In this context, coattail effects emerge as voters
strategically align their choices to maximize the electoral success of
their preferred candidates or parties. Moreover, the mobilization and
campaign resources available to successful candidates at the top of
the ticket contribute to coattail effects. Candidates who achieve
popularity or success often have access to substantial campaign
resources, including financial support, grassroots organization, and
endorsements. They can utilize these resources to mobilize voters and
support other candidates from their party, thereby amplifying coattail
effects.

Party unity and coordination are also crucial factors in the
manifestation of coattail effects. When candidates at different levels
of government campaign collectively and emphasize a shared party
message or platform, it enhances the likelihood of coattail
effects. The coordinated efforts of candidates and parties strengthen
the overall image and appeal of the party, leading to a positive
spill-over effect that influences voters' choices in related
elections. 

Concurrent (or combined) elections provide a context in which these factors
manifest, interact and operate influencing voter behavior. The
presence of multiple elections on the same ballot allows for the
potential transfer of support from popular candidates or parties to
other candidates or parties running in different contests. The shared
voter behavior and spillover effect observed in coattail effects can
be amplified in concurrent elections\footnote{Among other things,
concurrent elections tend to be used often to increase turnout and
enhances participation of peripheral votes.}. In non-concurrent
elections, however, coattail effects may be less direct and
pronounced since the temporal separation between different electoral
contests reduces the immediate spillover effect of popularity or
success from one election to another. In this situation, sub-national
governments may have incentives for strategic behavior. We explore
this possibility by looking at the decision to set the (sub-national)
election date since governors are not restricted to hold the election
at a specified date. 

The Argentine case is of particular interest due to several
features. Firstly, regions are afforded a great deal of political
autonomy when choosing their electoral rules. Secondly, there has been
an ongoing process of denationalization of political parties occuring
since 2002-03. Thirdly, due to different institutional designs for
executive office at different levels of government, a likely scenario
often appears: Presidents come to power with often limited elecotral
support, a fragmented, multi-party national legislature and state
governorns with strong electoral support. There is also the issue of
great discretion in the use of intergovernmental fiscal transfers
which often follow a political rather than redistributive logic. 

In this paper we study how the electoral performance of elected
Presidents is related to the electoral performance of elected
governors accounting for two key elements: 1) intergovernmental
transfers to subnational jurisdictions; 2) concurrence of both
executive-level elections. The main motivation of the paper is to
contribute an explanation of the pattern of vote shares of both
elected Presidents and governors as shown in the figure. The figure
shows elected Presidents tend to grow their electoral performance in
the different provinces specially when they have been elected with a
relatively small share of the national vote.

![Vote share of elected Presidents and governors](relative.jpg)

The intuition for a reverse coattail effect in a decentralized setting
is as follows: rational voters in a sub-national election perceive
governors to be responsible for a large part of public service
delivery thereby becoming more informed and scrutinizing of the
subnational executive election. Furthermore, the reverse coattail
effect is likely to be larger the stronger the electoral performance
of elected governors. In these cases, regional elites may be able to
achieve political stability through gaining access to federal
resources in exchange for electoral support of the elected President. 

Brazil is a clear example of this situation. Governors are often less
foreign than Presidents to local voters. Given the absence of
nationalized parties, presidential candidates must often resort to
gaining the favour of state governors to increase their electoral
chances in the district [Samuels (2000)]. Ames (1994) also suggests
that all Presidential candidates in the 1989 election performed better
in municipalities where local mayors supported them. 

In our analysis, we use data on vote shares for elected Presidents and
governors at the departament-level for 2003-2019, which comprises 5
(five) Presidential elections and 5 (five) cycles of gubernatorial
elections. We also use data on fiscal transfers for the period
2005-2019. These data are aggregated at the provincial level, however,
so we are not able to detect within-province variation but
between-province variation. 

The next section reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents
the main characteristics of the Argentine political and federal
system while at the same time highlighting several features of dynamic
political interactions between national and sub-national
governments. Section 4 introduces the data and methodology presenting
some descriptive statistic. Section 5 discusses the main results and
imlications.

# Literature

This paper has primary roots in the literature of coattail
effects. This literature on coattail effects dates back to the idea
that different types of voters turn out in presidential and midterm
elections thus affecting and influencing the outcomes in down-ballot
(legislative) elections [@campbell1960]. Other theories supported
explanations based on how voters cast their ballots. For example,
[[@tufte1975], characterized congressional elections as a sort of
"referendum" on the president in which voters reward or punish the
party of the president and therefore voting for representatives mainly
on the basis of their support (or rejection) of the
president. Similarly, [@alesina1989partisan] argued that voters who
prefer a stricter control on the executive tend to use midterms
elections to balance out the executive and legislative branches
thereby voting for the non-incumbent party in midterm elections. 

Another related strand of this literature examines coattail effects
but rather looking at differences between different tiers of
government. [@samuels2000concurrent] look at gubernatorial coattail effects in
Brazil exploring the congruence of alliance patterns for presidential,
gubernatorial and congressional elections; the author finds that there
is a much larger congruence between gubernatorial and congressional
alliances. In a related paper, [@samuels2000gubernatorial] finds that
the effective number of parties at the national congressional election
is closely correlated with the effective number parties at the
gubernational election. In a similar vein, [@magar2012gubernatorial]
examines whether gubernatorial candidates have coattails helping
candidates get elected to higher office. He finds mixed evidence
--governors transferred to congressional candidates 49% of their gubernatorial success since 1979
and 69% since 1997. However, the author notes that gubernatorial
coattails are larger than presidential coattails. 

There is also a more recent strand of research on coattail effects
focusing on exploring the relationship between same-office,
different-level elections, or "vertical" coattails as if often
referred to in the literature. [@tompkins1988have] finds that
gubernatorial elections have become more distinctive from the national
context using data for US elections for the period 1947-1986. More
recently, [@gadjanova2019treacherous] examines both
Presidential and gubernatorial elections in Kenya and finds
significant coattail effects that run from Presidential to
gubernatorial candidates in safe districts and in the opposite
direction (reverse coattail effect) in swing
districts. [@fullmer2018invisible] report standard coattail effects
when looking at positive effects of Presidential approval rates on
gubernatorial vote shares. In a similar vein, [@holbrook1987national]
finds that gubernatorial elections are sensitive to swings in the
national economy and presidential popularity. Another recent paper
[@ventura2021mayors] finds that parties in Brazil boost their national
performance, earning more votes in congressional elections in
districts that are governed by members of their party. 

In a similar vein, [@borges2016presidential] study how concurrent
"vertical" elections in strong federal systems affect electoral
coordination and coattails voting between levels. They find that
congruence between national and sub-national level increases when
elections are temporally proximate and the effective number of
candidates is low. In related papers [@borges2017pathways] and
[@borgessrong] they explore the workings of fiscal federalism in
Argentina under different economic contexts. They argue that
national-subnational relations render a positive-sum game when
obeconomic conditions are strong and this in turn leads to party
nationalization; the opposite is the case when economic conditions are
weak. They suggest, however, that in the absence of strong
presidential candidates, the most effective path to nationalization
may be to adapt to local electoral markets and maximize performance in
sub-national electoral races. Our paper elaborates on this idea and
applies it to the Argentina case.  

[@benton2009makes] explores the relationship between fiscal resources
and the dynamics of federalism in Argentina. She argues that despite having a formal federal structure, the actual power dynamics between the national and provincial governments are heavily influenced by the control over fiscal resources. The study reveals that the central government's authority over revenue allocation and distribution mechanisms gives it significant leverage, undermining the autonomy of provincial governments. This unequal distribution of fiscal resources creates a perception of weak federalism, as the central government can exert influence and shape policy decisions at the provincial level. 

We explore the relationship between electoral support for the winning
President and governors at the department-district level. In other
words, we are not interested in looking for the relationship between
these two variables for candidates of each party but rather focus on
those who win. 

# Governorns, politics and elections in Argentina

Argentina is divided into 23 districts called Provinces and
one autonomous district, the Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires
(CABA). All these districts elect their governors for a 4-year term through direct
election in a single-member district and different voting
rules\footnote{Unlike the executive leaders in the provinces, The
governor of CABA is called \textit{chief of government}.}. By and large,
provinces use some form of simple plurality rule. A few provinces have
other rules, mainly conditional two-round system (TRS) and majority
rule with TRS. @tbl-votingrule describes the current institutional features

: Electoral system and voting rule in sub-national districts {#tbl-votingrule}

When Argentina reinstated democracy in 1983, there were no provisions
for re-election of executives at either the national and sub-national
level. As [@altavilla2017] notes, 9 of the then 22 provinces reformed
their constitutions\footnote{These were La Rioja, Salta, Santiago del
Estero, San Juan, Jujuy, Córdoba, San Luis, Catamarca and Río
Negro.}. In all but one case, these reforms introduced the possibility
of executive re-election. This trend continued during the 90s where
the remaining provinces with two newly created districts --province of
Tierra del Fuego and Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires- also
incorporated the re-election clause in the new constitutions. The last
wave of constitutional reforms took place during the 2000s. In a
similar fashion as with the voting rule, there is heterogeneity in the institutional
design. @tbl-reelection shows the range and type of re-election clause
for all provinces. Most provinces have

 : Re-election regime in sub-national districts {#tbl-reelection}


Gubernatorial elections take place in the same year as
the presidential election but governors can decide on the election
date. This means they can choose not to vote on national election
day. This decision is not entirely independent, however, as there may
be *de-facto* political constraints: governors may be persuaded by
party officials and members of the national ruling coalition into
setting the election date in line with the Presidential election

Notwithstanding these political constraints, governors do in fact
seem to use their autonomy to tinker with the gubernatorial election
date. This can be seen in @tbl-concurrent where aside from the
first two elections where there was full concurrency or full
non-concurrency, every other election year saw an important number of
provinces voting on a different date than the national presidential
election. This is particularly evident in more recent elections. It is
also important to note that this happens both at relatively high and
low values of the effective number of parties (ENP) measure.

 : Concurrent and non-concurrent gubernatorial elections through the
   years {#tbl-concurrent}

From the discussion above, we observe that governors tend to
manipulate the executive election date. Since they do not have
institutional constraints as is the case for the presidential
election\footnote{The dates for national executive elections,
including primaries, general and second-round, are set in the
\textit{Ley de Partidos Políticos}. Primaries take place during the
second sunday in August, while the general election takes place during
the fourth sunday in October. These dates cannot be changed.}. We
argue this incentive may be dependent on various factors such as the
the strength of the governor \textit{vis-a-vis} the strength of the
President, the political alignment of both national and sub-national
ruling parties and personal career ambitions by sub-national
politicians. In this paper, we focus on the first two reasons.
