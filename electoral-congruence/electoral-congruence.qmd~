# Abstract

In this paper we study the relationship between electoral outcomes for both federal and state level executive elections. Electoral outcomes for different offices in multi-tiered systems are likely to be mutually influenced through multiple channels. We explore two of this channels in this paper: institutional design and coattail effects. Traditionally, coattail effects have been studied between executive and legislative elections for the same government level. Instead, we explore both coattail effects and vote congruence for different-level office. Using data disaggregated at the department-level comprising 5 (five) elections during 2003-2019, we examine the relationship between votes for the elected President and governor in every district. We find evidence of vote dissimilarity between elected Presidents and governors and this is particularly strong when the national executive election is contested. Elected Presidents tend to increase their district-level relative electoral strength vis-a-vis elected gobernors regardless of party and coalition. This is consistent with anecdotal evidence and insights on the characteristis of coalition-building between national and sub-national governments.

# Resumen

En este artículo estudiamos la relación entre los resultados electorales para cargos ejecutivos nacionales y sub-nacionales. Los resultados electorales para diferentes cargos en sistemas multinivel son influenciados mutuamente a través de múltiples canales. Exploramos dos de estos canales: el diseño institucional y los efectos de arrastre. Tradicionalmente, los efectos de arrastre han sido estudiados entre elecciones a diferentes cargos (ejecutivas y legislativas) para un mismo nivel de gobierno. En este trabajo, exploramos los efectos de arrastre y la congruencia del voto para iguales cargos de diferente nivel de gobierno. Usando datos desagregados al nivel departamental para 5 (cinco) elecciones ejecutivas entre 2003 y 2019, examinamos la relación entre los votos obtenidos por el Presidente y gobernador electo en cada distrito. Encontramos evidencia de dismilaridad de votos entre los Presidentes y gobernadores electos y esta es particularmente importante cuando la elección nacional es disputada. Los Presidentes electos tienen a mejorar su desempeño electoral a nivel de distrito relativo al de los gobernadores electos independientemente de su partido y coalición. Esta evidencia se corresponde con evidencia anecdótica y caracterizaciones del proceso de construcción de coaliciones entre los gobiernos nacionales y sub-nacionales en Argentina. 	 

# Motivation

Coattail effects have been regularly studied by the political science
and political economy literature. By and large, most work focuses on
the standard coattail effect which sees executive-level candidates
shoring up vote shares of legislative-level candidates due to
appearing in the same ballot. However, there is the theoretical (and
empirical) possibility of a reverse coattail effect whereby
executive-level candidate rides on the coattails of legislative-level
candidates. Broockman (2009) suggests that the reverse coattail effect
is somewhat implicit in the traditional version since coattail effects
can go both ways.  Furthermore, there is another type of coattail
effect if we consider elections at multiple government tiers. In
particular, we study the existence of a subnational reverse coattail
effect in Argentina for the period 2003-2019. 


The Argentine case is of particular interest due to several
features. Firstly, regions are afforded a great deal of political
autonomy when choosing their electoral rules. Secondly, there has been
an ongoing process of denationalization of political parties occuring
since 2002-03. Thirdly, due to different institutional designs for
executive office at different levels of government, a likely scenario
often appears: Presidents come to power with often limited elecotral
support, a fragmented, multi-party national legislature and state
governorns with strong electoral support. There is also the issue of
great discretion in the use of intergovernmental fiscal transfers
which often follow a political rather than redistributive logic. 

In this paper we study how the electoral performance of elected
Presidents is related to the electoral performance of elected
governors accounting for two key elements: 1) intergovernmental
transfers to subnational jurisdictions; 2) concurrence of both
executive-level elections. The main motivation of the paper is to
contribute an explanation of the pattern of vote shares of both
elected Presidents and governors as shown in the figure. The figure
shows elected Presidents tend to grow their electoral performance in
the different provinces specially when they have been elected with a
relatively small share of the national vote.

The intuition for a reverse coattail effect in a decentralized setting
is as follows: rational voters in a sub-national election perceive
governors to be responsible for a large part of public service
delivery thereby becoming more informed and scrutinizing of the
subnational executive election. Furthermore, the reverse coattail
effect is likely to be larger the stronger the electoral performance
of elected governors. In these cases, regional elites may be able to
achieve political stability through gaining access to federal
resources in exchange for electoral support of the elected President. 

Brazil is a clear example of this situation. Governors are often less
foreign than Presidents to local voters. Given the absence of
nationalized parties, presidential candidates must often resort to
gaining the favour of state governors to increase their electoral
chances in the district [Samuels (2000)]. Ames (1994) also suggests
that all Presidential candidates in the 1989 election performed better
in municipalities where local mayors supported them. 

In our analysis, we use data on vote shares for elected Presidents and
governors at the departament-level for 2003-2019, which comprises 5
(five) Presidential elections and 5 (five) cycles of gubernatorial
elections. We also use data on fiscal transfers for the period
2005-2019. These data are aggregated at the provincial level, however,
so we are not able to detect within-province variation but
between-province variation. 



# Federalism in Argentina

Governors in Argentina are elected via direct election for a
four-year term. Gubernatorial elections take place in the same year as
the presidential election but governors can decide on the election
date. This decision is not entirely independent, however, as they may
